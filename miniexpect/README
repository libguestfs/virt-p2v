Miniexpect is a very simple expect-like library

Expect (https://core.tcl-lang.org/expect/index) is a venerable Tcl
program for automating interactive services, often for automating
logins over telnet, ftp, ssh, etc.

Miniexpect is a C library which has a saner interface than libexpect,
and doesn't depend on Tcl.  It is also thread safe, const-correct and
uses modern C standards.

Miniexpect is standalone, except that it requires the PCRE2 (Perl
Compatible Regular Expressions) library from http://www.pcre.org/.
The PCRE2 dependency is fundamental because we want to offer the most
powerful regular expression syntax to match on, but more importantly
because PCRE2 has a convenient way to detect partial matches which
made miniexpect very simple to implement.

License
-------

The library was written by Richard W.M. Jones <rjones@redhat.com>
and is licensed under the Library GPL (LGPL) version 2 or above.

Using the library
-----------------

If you wanted to copy the library into your own code (instead of
linking to it as a dependency), you only need to copy the two files:
miniexpect.h, miniexpect.c.

The API is documented in the manual page (miniexpect.pod / miniexpect.3).

For examples of how to use the API in reality, see the examples and
tests in the source directory.
